# She-Directed-It

As a cinephile, I have always loved discovering new directors, unknown casts, and niche movie genres. Spanning French New Wave classics, 80s slashers, and Jacques Demy musicals, my movie tastes are eclectic and I take great pleasure in stepping outside my comfort zone. However, this is not the case for everyone. Mainstream movies are predominantly directed by men and many talented female film directors are still unknown to the masses. 

    The core of She Directed It is geared towards gender inequalies in the film industry. A report published by the European Audiovisual Observatory published last year captured my attention. 
    Between 2017 and 2021 women only accounted for 25% of all directors of European feature films. The gender gap was even more visible among composers and cinematographers, where women only represented 10% of the workforce. In turn, the female share was higher among producers (34%) and screenwriters (28%).

This example is a reminder of the significant gender disparity prevalent in the film industry, highlighting the lack of female representation within its workforce. My project aims to shed light on the few women who are represented in this industry. The user will select the movies they have watched and liked from a selection of male-directed movies. Based on the features of both movies, a machine-learning algorithm will recommend similarl movies directed by women. I will be using an unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbors model.

However, my project is not only limited to machine learning, it also involves finding and cleaning the data, conducting EDA and graphic visualization, creating a database entity relationship diagram, setting up the database, and querying data from it and gain insights into the social realities of the film industry. I hope for my project to entice movie watchers in discovering the brilliant women directors who are making movies in the shadows.
